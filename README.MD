Here's the plan:

We need to obtain:

1. 1 dataset each for each role. With all the possible variables that actually contribute to points (e.g. goals scored, clean sheets, etc.). We will use these to predict the score for each player.

2. 1 dataset containing each player's predicted goals scored, etc. (variables that directly contribute to points).

3. 1 dataset containing historical data in order to create the dataset in point 2.
